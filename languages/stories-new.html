                <p class="bio">
                    Marc is pursuing a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida. He speaks 5 languages: Catalan, Spanish, English, German and French.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He grew up in Catalonia, where both Catalan and Spanish are official languages. He learned both languages as a result, but considers Catalan to be his mother tongue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He decided to learn German at age 14, guided by his interest in engineering. Since Germany is a nexus for engineering in Europe, he knew he would eventually need to speak German to communicate with his colleagues. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He ended up pursuing a master’s degree in Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His best experience with the language? He is proud of defending his master’s thesis in German—followed closely by the first time he dreamt in German while living abroad. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His advice to language learners: “Practice, practice, practice. Don’t be shy; even if you aren’t totally confident, speaking is how I learned the most.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marc used German to advance his engineering career. It just goes to show that if you can dream it, then you can do it. And if you’re lucky, you might even dream it in German.

                    Irene is currently pursuing a master’s degree in Mass Communications. She speaks Spanish, English, Catalan, French and a bit of German. A native Spanish speaker, she learned English and French in school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She started learning Catalan when she began dating her husband from Tarragona, since he spoke with his friends and family in Catalan. 
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Learning languages has opened up many opportunities for her. She has studied in the United States in two different stints. Catalan has helped her grow closer with her husband’s family and friends. She has also found apologizing in Catalan an effective tool for placating an angry husband.  
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Her advice to language learners:<br>
                    Immerse yourself in the language. Her English improved considerably when she started watching TV and reading books in English. For those looking to learn English, she found “Friends” to be a valuable resource.

                    Katie works as an immigration adviser at the University of Florida, where she is also working towards a master’s degree in Mass Communications.
                </p>
                <p>                     
                    She began learning French to try to feel a connection to her grandfather, who passed away before she met him. “My grandfather loved French. I thought studying the language might help me understand him.”
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    For Katie, speaking French has provided many opportunities: French has helped her create relationships in countries where it is not the primary language and helped her get by in countries where it is. It has also given 
                 </p>
                 <p>                   
                    Katie’s French really paid dividends when she met a man from Haiti. He seemed reserved—even uneasy and stuttered when he spoke in English. The joy came from his reaction to her asking him in French if he preferred to talk French instead. The similarity between Creole and French made it much easier for him to open up to her.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    He mentioned that it was difficult for him to communicate in English with the stutter and that he was more comfortable this way. Seeing his face light up and hearing his stutter disappear made learning French worth it to Katie. She helped someone else out and made a new friend in the process.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Her advice to language learners:<br>
                    “Don’t be afraid to make mistakes or sound stupid. Displacement and feeling uncomfortable is a great thing.” 
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Being around native speakers may seem daunting, but for Katie, immersing yourself in potentially uncomfortable situations is just part of the process. In the end, you will become better for it and you will even gain respect for others who have gone through the same thing to learn your language.

                        Hunter started learning French this year. He takes French classes in Gainesville, Florida, but he gets a lot of practice at the Gainesville Language Exchange (GLX), a weekly meetup at a local bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He takes the opportunity to meet people from different cultures and practice with other French speakers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was inspired to learn a new language after taking a trip to Europe, where he hitchhiked from Lisbon, Portugal to Frankfurt, Germany. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His memory of not being able to communicate effectively and truly connect with people who spoke different languages served as his motivation to start learning French. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many missed opportunities to really get to know some of the people along his journey, where he wished he could speak their language. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's why he takes the time to go to GLX.

                    "It just brings language back to its roots. I'm not learning French so I can study and study and study, I'm learning French so I can <em>talk to people</em>."
